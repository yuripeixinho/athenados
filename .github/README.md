Athenados is a Brazilian study platform aimed at preparing students for the National High School Exam. Also known nationally as (ENEM). The objective is the democratization of education, aiming to bring equality to Brazilian education. The platform brings all the questions that have already fallen in ENEM for students to practice in the most immersive way possible.

# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This project was born from an initiative of two high school students who realized the difficulty of democratizing education in Brazil. With Athenados, students of all incomes can access a completely free database on all platforms. Athenados is a completely free platform in which there is a collection of exercises for all subjects that fall into the ENEM (in Brazil, the ENEM is a very important test that determines whether high school students will or will not enter a university).

 ## WHOY DOES THIS PROJECT EXIST?
As stated earlier, Brazilian education is precarious and completely unequal. Our initiative aims to raise awareness and encourage one or more developers with projects focused on social welfare. As digital natives, the developers of these projects seek that this way there is more social harmony and that this way we can influence more people to participate in these projects, feel free to fork, star or publicize the initiatives for good.
